                        <h3>Neutrophils Extracellular Traps Inhibition Improves PD-1 Blockade Immunotherapy in Colorectal Cancer</h3>
                        <span>by UBBY Team</span>
                        <p>
                            Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve the prognosis of patients with advanced malignancy; however, only a small subset of advanced colorectal cancer patients in microsatellite-instability-high or mismatch-repair-deficient colorectal cancer can benefit from immunotherapy. Unfortunately, the mechanism behind this ineffectiveness is unclear. The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer immunity, and may contribute to the inhibition of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other novel immunotherapies in patients with advanced cancer. Herein, we demonstrate that the DNase I enzyme plays a pivotal role in the degradation of NETs, significantly dampening the resistance to anti-PD-1 blockade in a mouse colorectal cancer model by attenuating tumor growth. Remarkably, DNase I decreases tumor-associated neutrophils and the formation of MC38 tumor cell-induced neutrophil extracellular trap formation in vivo. Mechanistically, the inhibition of neutrophil extracellular traps with DNase I results in the reversal of anti-PD-1 blockade resistance through increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity. These findings signify a novel approach to targeting the tumor microenvironment using DNase I alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Full article

                        <h3>MicroRNAs in Molecular Classification and Pathogenesis of Breast Tumors</h3>
                        <span>by UBBY Team</span>
                        <p>
                            Abstract The current clinical practice of breast tumor classification relies on the routine immunohistochemistry-based expression analysis of hormone receptors, which is inadequate in addressing breast tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. MicroRNA expression profiling in tumor tissue and in the circulation is an efficient alternative [...] Read more.
